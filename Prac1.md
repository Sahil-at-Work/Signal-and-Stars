# Signals to Stars  
## Practical 1A — Visualizing Signals in Time Domain

---

## 🎯 Objective

In this practical session, we move from theory to visualization.

We will:

- Generate a sine wave  
- Generate a square wave  
- Generate random noise  
- Plot signals in the time domain  
- Add noise to a sine wave and observe distortion  

This practical demonstrates the core idea from Lecture 1:

> A signal is variation that carries information.

## 🧠 Concept Overview

We simulate three fundamental signal types:

### 1. Sine Wave
- Deterministic  
- Periodic  
- Ideal representation of structured information  

### 2. Square Wave
- Digital switching behavior  
- Contains multiple frequency components  
- Common in embedded and communication systems  

### 3. Random Noise
- Unpredictable variation  
- Present in all real-world systems  
- Degrades signal quality  

Finally, we combine signal and noise to simulate realistic measurements.
